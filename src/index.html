        <div class="close">&times;</div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        Your privacy and the security of your personal information are very important to us. We want you to be as comfortable as possible visiting our Website and using our Online Resources. We are dedicated to protecting the privacy of those who visit our Website and use our Online Resources. This Privacy Policy governs T1D Huddle, and explains how we collect your personal information on our Website, how we protect such information, and the choices you have concerning the use of such information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. We will not sell, share, license, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

        <br><br>
  
        We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to anyone. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. By using our Website or any of our resources, features or tools that we provide on our Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
  
        <br><br>
  
        <b>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE OR THROUGH OUR ONLINE  RESOURCES?</b>
        <br><br>
  
        We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.
        <br><br>
  
        <b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>
        <br><br>
  
        Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Such Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number and birth date (primarily for eligibility purposes). We may request Personally Identifiable Information from you when you register on our Website. We will collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
  
        You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections of our Website or use all of our Online Resources.
  
        <br><br>
  
        <b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>
  
        <br><br>
  
        Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us understand who uses our Website and to improve its features.
  
        <br><br>
  
        <b>Information from Other Sources</b>
  
        <br><br>
  
        We may also supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Website and Online Resources, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our Website and Online Resources to your needs, and/or to study nutritional, weight-loss, behavioural, emotional and fitness questions in general.
        <br><br>
  
        <b>WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE OR THROUGH OUR ONLINE PRODUCTS (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES AND ACTION TAGS)?</b>
        <br><br>
  
        We may collect information (including information that is Personally Identifiable Information) from you in different manners and at different places and times on our Website, subscribe to one of our Online Resources. The following is a description of the areas and/or manners in which we primarily collect information about you.
        <br><br>
        <b>Becoming a Subscriber</b>
        <br><br>
        In order to access certain Online Resources you must first complete certain steps to become a Subscriber.
        <br><br>
        During these steps, you may be required to provide us with information (including Personally Identifiable Information) such as name, zip code or postal code and email address. This information is used to help us understand who uses our Website, to improve our Website and our Online Resources.
        <br><br>
        <b>Cookies and Action Tags</b>
        <br><br>
        We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information passively using "cookies" and "action tags."
        <br><br>
        "Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify (i) your Web browser, (ii) the activities of your computer on our Website and (iii) your activity in connection with our advertisements and other marketing and promotional efforts. Cookies may be used to: personalize your experience on our Website (e.g., to dynamically generate content on web pages specifically designed for you), assist you in using our Online Resources (e.g., to save you time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to our Website), and allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website for purposes of improving our online offerings.
        <br><br>
        You do not have to accept cookies to use our Website, however, you may not be able to use certain resources of our Website if you do not accept cookies.
        <br><br>
        Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar.
        <br><br>
        "Action tags," also known as web beacons or GIF tags, are a web technology used to help track anonymous website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of our Website, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain action tags. Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer.
        <br><br>
        By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve our Website and our Online Resources and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns. We do not disclose any of your Personally Identifiable Information to our advertising partners through the use of cookies or action tags.
        <br><br>
        This Privacy Policy does not govern the use by third-party websites or providers of third-party advertising.
        <br><br>
        <b>Log Files</b>
        <br><br>
        We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website. This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to monitor our Website's use, and to gather general demographic information. We may link this information to Personally Identifiable Information for these and other purposes such as personalizing your experience on our Website and evaluating our Online Products in general.
        <br><br>
        <b>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE?</b>
        <br><br>
        We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Our Website and Online Resources are not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. We urge all parents or guardians to participate in their children's exploration of the Internet, and to teach their children about protecting their personal information while online.
        <br><br>
        <b>WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</b>
        <br><br>
        In general, we use the information collected on our Website and through our Online Resources to help us understand who uses our Website and Online Resources and how they are used, to personalize your experience, to assist you in using our Online Resources, to improve our Website and Online Resources.

        To respond to your questions or comments, we may file your questions or comments for future reference. We may also use the information collected to send you important service announcements and updates regarding our Website or Online Resources. You will not be able to opt-out of these service announcements and updates as they contain important information relevant to your use of our Website and/or our Online Resources and are not promotional in nature.

        <br><br>
        <b>WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES?</b>
        <br><br>
        Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, we will not disclose any information we gather from you on our Website.
        <br><br>
        <b>Affiliates</b>
        <br><br>
        We may disclose information (including Personally Identifiable Information) about you to our Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with T1D Huddle whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
        <br><br>
        <b>Laws and Legal Rights</b>
        <br><br>
        We may also disclose your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms & Conditions or our Subscription Agreement, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our Website or the general public.
        <br><br>
        <b>Third Parties Generally</b>
        <br><br>
        We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website.
        <br><br>
        <b>Outside Contractors</b>
        <br><br>
        We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services and products related to our Website or Online Resources, such as fraud screening, and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted.
        <br><br>
        <b>Sale of Business</b>
        <br><br>
        We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Project Bhangra provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will notify users of any such transfer through notice on our site and through email.
        <br><br>
        <b>DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN YOU LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?</b>
        <br><br>
        Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by T1D Huddle. We will attempt to make it obvious to you when you leave our Website and enter these websites by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website. However, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites. We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Website or through our Online Resources.
        <br><br>
        <b>IS THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT SECURE?</b>
        <br><br>
        We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible. We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry- standard techniques. We secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Only individuals with our team who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. In addition, all individuals associated with Project Bhangra must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices. Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
        <br><br>
        <b>CAN YOU UPDATE OR CORRECT YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</b>
        <br><br>
        You can always contact us in order to (1) update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained about you on our systems, by contacting our Privacy Coordinator at the address set out below. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.
        <br><br>
        You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our systems. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable.
        <br><br>
        <b>HOW WILL YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</b>
        <br><br>
        If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email or otherwise, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in the new manner. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your Personally Identifiable Information. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Website.
        <br><br>
        <b>WHOM DO YOU CONTACT IF YOU HAVE ANY PRIVACY QUESTIONS?</b>
